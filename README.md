## :trophy: Goals & Milestones

### Goals

01. üîç **Track important data.**
    Tracking microtransactions is extremely time consuming, especially when you have a lot of them spread out across multiple credit cards. 

02. üîê **Keep your data local and private.**
    Why should you have to worry about privacy policies that you're never gonna read? Who knows what these crazy people are doing with your data. 

03. üìä **Useful reports.**
    Here's the thing: I want to know how much my household owes these credit card companies. And I want it in a nice UI ‚Äî not some table-like, hard-to-use five-clicks-to-add-a-single-transaction app. 

04. ‚ö°Ô∏è **Shortcuts and hotkeys.**
    Come on, you're a developer. Why should you click on your finance app to do things? Let's make tracking finances easier with quick keystrokes.

## :runner: Run the project on your machine (or deploy it somewhere only you know :beach_umbrella:)

### 01. First Install all dependencies by running:

```
yarn
```
_Or `npm install` if you're not into the amazingness of yarn. :eyes:_

### 02. If you want to develop and make changes to it:

```
yarn dev
```
_Or `npm run dev`... Whatever. :roll_eyes:_


### 03. If you want to deploy it yourself, the build command is:

```
yarn build
```
_Or, **again**, `npm run build`. Gosh, you're weird._
