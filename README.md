# üè° Home Bills 

**Minimalistic bill tracker for those who despise tracking microtransactions.**

<br>


## :trophy: Goals & Milestones

### Goals

01. üîç **Track important data.**
    Tracking microtransactions is extremely time consuming, especially when you have a lot of them spread out across multiple credit cards. 

02. üîê **Keep your data local and private.**
    Why should you have to worry about privacy policies that you're never gonna read? Who knows what these crazy people are doing with your data. 

03. üìä **Useful reports.**
    Here's the thing: I want to know how much my household owes these credit card companies. And I want it in a nice UI ‚Äî not some table-like, hard-to-use five-clicks-to-add-a-single-transaction app. 

04. ‚ö°Ô∏è **Shortcuts and hotkeys.**
    Come on, you're a developer. Why should you click on your finance app to do things? Let's make tracking finances easier with quick keystrokes.

### Milestones

**01. The Minimum Viable Code.**

- [x] Design a friendly and minimal interface.
- [ ] Code the entire interface reponsively.
- [ ] Open "Add Bills" pop-up.
    - [ ] Add "CMD + N" shortcut to add new bills
- [ ] Data handling with localStorage (MVP).
- [ ] Generate reports with JS.
- [ ] Open Source it: add a license, make repo public, and document.

**02. Better Data Management**

- [ ] Handle data with a local JSON file that you can store and sync with your iCloud, or GDrive.
- [ ] Ability to visualize your bills from your computer, phone, or tablet.

**03. Mobile App: I can see...**

## :runner: Run the project on your machine (or deploy it somewhere only you know :beach_umbrella:)

### 01. First Install all dependencies by running:

```
yarn
```
_Or `npm install` if you're not into the amazingness of yarn. :eyes:_

### 02. If you want to develop and make changes to it:

```
yarn dev
```
_Or `npm run dev`... Whatever. :roll_eyes:_


### 03. If you want to deploy it yourself, the build command is:

```
yarn build
```
_Or, **again**, `npm run build`. Gosh, you're weird._
