## :runner: Run the project on your machine (or deploy it somewhere only you know :beach_umbrella:)

### 01. First Install all dependencies by running:

```
yarn
```
_Or `npm install` if you're not into the amazingness of yarn. :eyes:_

### 02. If you want to develop and make changes to it:

```
yarn dev
```
_Or `npm run dev`... Whatever. :roll_eyes:_


### 03. If you want to deploy it yourself, the build command is:

```
yarn build
```
_Or, **again**, `npm run build`. Gosh, you're weird._
